---

## 📊 JEE Main 2024 Format Compliance

### ✅ Exact Question Distribution
```
Total Questions: 75
├── Physics: 25 questions (20 MCQ + 5 Numerical)
├── Chemistry: 25 questions (20 MCQ + 5 Numerical)
└── Mathematics: 25 questions (20 MCQ + 5 Numerical)

Overall: 60 MCQ + 15 Numerical = 75 Questions
Time: 180 minutes (3 hours)
```

### ✅ Format Verification Results
- **Total Questions**: 75 ✓
- **MCQ Questions**: 60 (80%) ✓
- **Numerical Questions**: 15 (20%) ✓
- **Per-Subject Distribution**: 25 each ✓
- **Subject MCQ Count**: 20 each ✓
- **Subject Numerical Count**: 5 each ✓

---

## 🔧 Technical Refinements Made

### 1. Enhanced Question Generation Logic
- **Fixed `generate_jee_questions()` method** to enforce exact JEE 2024 pattern
- **Added `force_type` parameter** to `_generate_jee_question()` for precise MCQ/Numerical control
- **Subject-wise generation** maintains proper question type distribution
- **Preserved subject grouping** for full mock tests (no random shuffling)

### 2. Updated Configuration System
```python
@dataclass
class JEETestConfig:
    # JEE Main 2024 Format Settings
    total_questions: int = 75
    mcq_questions_per_subject: int = 20
    numerical_questions_per_subject: int = 5
    total_mcq_questions: int = 60
    total_numerical_questions: int = 15
```

### 3. Backend API Synchronization
- **FastAPI endpoints** updated to handle 75-question format
- **Session management** supports exact question distribution
- **Scoring system** validates against correct JEE pattern
- **Interface configuration** matches NTA Abhyas style
