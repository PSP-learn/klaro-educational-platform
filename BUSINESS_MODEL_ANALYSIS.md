## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR COST CONTROL**

### **1. Smart Problem Classification** (Saves 60% on AI costs)
```python
def classify_problem_type(question):
    # Computational keywords
    calc_keywords = ['solve', 'calculate', 'find', 'derivative', 'integral']
    if any(word in question.lower() for word in calc_keywords):
        return "computational"  # → Wolfram Alpha ($0.0025)
    else:
        return "conceptual"     # → GPT-3.5 ($0.004)
```

### **2. Textbook Database Priority** (FREE solutions)
```python
async def solve_doubt_optimized(question):
    # Always try textbook database first (FREE!)
    textbook_answer = await search_textbooks(question)
    if textbook_answer.confidence > 0.7:
        return textbook_answer  # Cost: $0
    
    # Then use paid APIs only if needed
    return await ai_solve(question)
```

### **3. Caching Strategy** (Reduces repeat costs)
```python
# Cache common solutions
@cache_result(ttl=30_days)
async def solve_common_doubt(question):
    # Popular doubts solved once, served from cache
    # Saves ~30% on repeat questions
```
