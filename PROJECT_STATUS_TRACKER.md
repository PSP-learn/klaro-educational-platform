### 2025-09-06 04:40 UTC - Backend + Android Integration Progress
**COMPLETED TODAY**:
- ✅ Backend: Added alias route /api/catalog/chapters and created new /api/catalog/subtopics
- ✅ Backend: Health diagnostics /health/env added; env fallbacks (SUPABASE_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_*) supported
- ✅ Backend: Made backend a package (backend/__init__.py); fixed imports and lazy init of Supabase client
- ✅ Backend: Deployed on Railway; verified chapters endpoint working in production
- ✅ DB: Created idempotent seed file for Class 12 Maths subtopics (backend/db/seed/seed_class12_math_subtopics.sql)
- ✅ Android: Chapters dropdown now calls absolute path; error/Retry UX added
- ✅ Android: Subtopics dropdown implemented; loads based on selected chapter
- ✅ Android: Added “Source” dropdown to PDF Quiz with requested options; plumbed to backend
- ✅ App built and installed on emulator; endpoints verified via OkHttp logs

**NEXT ACTIONS**:
- ⏩ Run the subtopics seed in Supabase SQL editor to populate subtopics for Class 12 Maths (others optional next)
- ⏩ Optionally persist quiz "source" in quiz_history (add column and update save_quiz)
- ⏩ Configure ENVIRONMENT=production in Railway for production docs behavior
- ⏩ Consider adding more seed coverage (Classes 9–11, Physics/Chemistry)

**STATUS**:
- 📱 Android: Chapters + Subtopics + Source wired to backend
- 🌐 Backend: Routes healthy; Supabase client active in prod

### 2025-09-06 12:02 UTC - Seed coverage extended to Classes 9–10 across subjects
COMPLETED:
- ✅ Added new grade-wise chapters for Class 9 & 10 (Physics/Chemistry/Biology): `backend/db/seed/seed_grade_9_10_chapters_science.sql`
- ✅ Added subtopic seeds for Class 9 & 10 across all subjects:
  - Mathematics: `seed_class9_math_subtopics.sql`, `seed_class10_math_subtopics.sql`
  - Physics: `seed_class9_physics_subtopics.sql`, `seed_class10_physics_subtopics.sql`
  - Chemistry: `seed_class9_chemistry_subtopics.sql`, `seed_class10_chemistry_subtopics.sql`
  - Biology: `seed_class9_biology_subtopics.sql`, `seed_class10_biology_subtopics.sql`
- ✅ Biology chapter coverage added to existing grade-wise chapters for Classes 11 & 12

NOTES:
- All seed files are idempotent via ON CONFLICT (subject_id, grade_id, name, parent_id).
- Run order: chapters first, then subtopics.

STATUS:
- 📚 DB content ready for Classes 9–12 across Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology.
- 📱 Android dropdowns can now populate for all classes/subjects once data is present.
